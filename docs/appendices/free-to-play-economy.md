# Free-to-Play Resources 
Certain resources in Wizardry Variants Daphne can be used to obtain in-game content or upgrade your adventuring party. While these can be purchased at the [Wizardry Variants Daphne Official Store](https://store.wizardry.info) at the Jeweler (see [Guide Purchase Evaluaions page](./purchase-evaluation.md)), Free-to-Play (F2P) players rely on resource accumulation over time. The summary below tries to cover regular, reliable accumulation methods of these resources. Other intermittent events can provide additional resource gain opportunities, and some of these are noted where appropriate.  

## Gems
There are two Gem types: Gems of Erin (Purple) and Gems of Org (Green).  
Purple Gems can only be obtained through one of the purchase methods mentioned above.  Both gem types generally exchange at the same rate for items, although certain Jeweler items are reserved for purchase with Purple gems.  Unless noted otherwise, details below refer only to Green Gems.

!!!note "Monthly totals assume a 30-day or 4 week month for easy math."

### Uses
Gems can be used throughout the game as a general currency for upgrades at the Jeweler (e.g., adventurer remains, equipment packs, spellbooks, class change books, ...) and in-game activities (e.g., resurrections, Mausoleum assistance, expanded inventory space, relic removal, ...). For some in-game activities gem usage is an option instead of spending Gold for the same item. Gems are scarce enough that use for those cases is discouraged. Popular uses are listed here:

#### "Banner" Adventurer Remains:
- The most popular gems use is to get adventurer remains that give a chance (typically 4-5%) to obtain new Legendary characters or new skins for existing characters.
- Limited time special remains are available from the Jeweler and typically cost 200 gems each, or 11 remains for 2000 gems.
- Limited remains usually give, along with the random character, one 'pity' token that can be exchanged at the Jeweler.
- Typically 100 (for legendary) or 60 (for non-legendary) tokens can be exchanged for remains that guarantee obtaining the banner character.
- Thus the minimum gem cost 100% guarantee getting the banner is:
    - 60: 5 x 2000 + 5 + 200 = 11,000 gems
    - 100: 9 x 2000 + 1 x 200 = 18,200 gems
    - Banner events sometimes provide 2-4 free remains that slightly reduce the above "guarantee" requirement.
    - Using the maximum regular gem rate of 2800 gems/month, a 'guaranteed pull' for a banner legendary character takes 18,200 / 2,800 = 6.5 months to accumulate.
    - This is often significantly reduced by irregular sources, with monthly 'possible' gem rates above being 3400-5300, reducing the time to 3.4-5.3 months.
    - In either case, banner adventurer offers generally come out more often than this, and <em>a F2P player should not expect to 'guarantee' getting every banner using free resources</em>.
    
#### Handbooks
- Ally class changes require class-change handbooks or similar items for every class change event for that character.
- Four random class change books are usually available each week at the Jeweler, at a cost of 400 gems each, with two limited to Purple Gems.

#### Inventory Storage Increase:
- The default inventory storage space is 500 slots.
- The limit can be increased by 25 items for 100 gems up to 1000 slots for total of 2000 gems.

## Guild Points
Guild points (blue tokens) are granted for completing activities at the Adventurers Guild

## Adventurer Remains
### Uses:
In this game, adventurer remains are used by the Masked Adventurer to resurrect allies to help him in his adventure.  Remains can be specific to one particular adventurer, or to a group or type of adventurer, or can be ordinary remains that pull from the general adventurer pool.  Gaining additional adventurers increases your party options and gaining duplicate copies of adventurers can increase the power of your adventuring party in numerous ways by [allowing skills to be inherited or increased in power](../mechanics/discipline-and-inheritance.md), or by providing adventurer tags for [grading up to higher levels](../abyss-guides/grade-exams/maps.md). As such accumulating adventurer remains is one of the primary ways, even a necessary way, of advancing in the game.

## Guild Tags
Guild Tags are required to increase a character's Guild Grade that sets the maximum level the adventurer can reach.  An [exam must be passed and a Guild Tag payment must be made](../abyss-guides/grade-exams/maps.md) to rise above level 20, and for every 10 levels thereafter.  In addition, the required Guild Tag [is formed by Unifying three tags of the previous level](../frequently-asked-questions.md#how-do-i-get-grade-tags).   

#### Tag Requirements per Adventurer per Grade
<div class="nofilter-table nosort-table" markdown>
| Adventurer Grade    | Max Level | Tag required | Ungraded Tag Cowt | Cumulative Ungraded Tags | Party of 6 Cumulative Tags|
| :------: | :-------: | :-----------------: | :----------------------: | :-------------------: | :----: |
| Ungraded | 20 | n/a | n/a  | 0  | 0|
| Lead     | 30 | Ungraded | 1  | 1  | 6|
| Bronze   | 40 | Lead | 2  | 3  | 18 |
| Iron     | 50 | Bronze | 4 | 7  | 42|
| Steel    | 60 | Iron | 8 | 15 | 90 |
</div>

As this table shows. the required number of tags for each grade grows quickly and tag accumulation can become a primary bottleneck for advancing in the games. A party of six adventurers requires a total of 90 ungraded guild tags to reach Steel Grade. 

#### Regular Guild Tags
<div class="nofilter-table nosort-table" markdown>
| Source                                       | Frequency | Amount | Monthly Total |

| Total                                |           |        | 20            | 
</div>

#### Irregular Guild Tags
<div class="nofilter-table nosort-table" markdown>
| Source                                    | Frequency | Amount    |
| :----------------------------------------- | :-------: | :-------: |
| "Urgent" Slay Dangerous Monsters Events    | ~ 1-2 Months | 10-15 |
</div>

#### Optional Guild Tags
Guild tags can be obtained by dismissing (retiring) adventurers from the guild. [See full details in the FAQ](../frequently-asked-questions.md#how-do-i-get-grade-tags). 

<div class="nofilter-table nosort-table" markdown>
| <em>Ungraded</em> Adventurer Type | Tags received on dismissal |
|:---:|:---:|
| Anonymous | 1 Ungraded|
| General | 2 Ungraded| 
| Legendary | 1 Iron Grade, 1 Ungraded (5 Ungraded equivalent)| 
</div>

At high grades, dismissing extra adventurers may be necessary or collecting enough Guild Tags to advance.  Using the numbers of regularly available  adventurers remains as described above, the available tags are: 

<div class="nofilter-table nosort-table" markdown>
| Remains  | Tags from dismissing 36 Ungraded Remains |
|:---:|:---:|
| All Anonymous | 36 |
| All General | 72 | 
| All Legendary | 36 ungraded, 36 iron | 
</div><!--
| *Expected Value<sup>â€ â€ â€ </sup>* | *57.6* |   

<small><sup>â€ â€ â€ </sup> using the standard adventurer remains drop rates: Anon:50%, General:45%, Legend:5%.</small>

- From this we see that a total of about 78 tags directly and from dismissed adventurers could be obtained monthly through regular means.  
- It would take a party of six adventurers a bit over a month using all free, regular tags and remains to accumulate the 90 tags needed for Steel grade.  
- Also using gems, ...
