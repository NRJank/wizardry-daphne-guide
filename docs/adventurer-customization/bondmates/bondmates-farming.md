!!! note "Bondmate Farming Notes"

    - Reacquiring a level 5 bondmate results in being given an Amnesia Incense, used to sever all bondmates from a character.  Amnesia Incense can be farmed weekly from each bondmate.  As of June 2025, story bondmates can no longer be 'dismissed'.
    - Certain bondmates are permanently capped at level 1. Further bond acquisitions just produces a 'will be missed' message.

## Beginning Abyss Bondmates

Using the Cursed Wheel, "Leaping" back to Fresh Start will reset most bondmate locations, and then immediately "Leaping" forward to Warped Scene or later will the most bondmate requests available again. 

!!! note "Special Cases"

    Pleading Boss Goblin:  
    - The Goblin Den is a higher level challenge than the rest of the Beginning Abyss, recommended saving for levels 30+ and bringing enough mage support to clear groups, or until you can survive the Ambushes and/or avoid most mobile enemy fights. Also, this will add one additional farming cycle, as on the first visit you only fight the Northeast goblin group. See the [Pleading Boss Goblin bondmate procedures](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#the-pleading-boss-goblin).

    Albano:  
    - After first earning the Albano bondmate by [completing the Beginning Abyss "Perfect Ending"](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#royal-knight-albano), repeat bonds are obtainable simply by Wheeling back to any point before "The King's Rescue", then leaping forward to "The King's Rescue" or later, and finally going to the Edge of Town screen in the Royal Capital.  The Albano Bondmate dialog should begin automatically, and he can be raised from level 1 to 5 in a matter of minutes. (Confirmed as of version 1.8.0.)

    Knowledge Requirement:  
    - Some bondmates below require gaining specific Knowledge before the farming paths can be followed. See individual pages for [Chris](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#chris-the-considerate), [Mudd](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#mudd-the-eternal-novice), and [Donato](./beginning-abyss/bondmates.md#donato-the-king-of-debt) for steps to follow.
