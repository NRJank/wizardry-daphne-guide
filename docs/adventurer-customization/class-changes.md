# Class Changes

## When Do I Unlock Class Changes?
You unlock class changes after you beat the Greater Warped One of the Beginning Abyss. For summonable heroes you unlock a weekly reseting shop for class change books for your summonable heroes. For your main character certain class changes are locked behind story progression.

## Do I Keep My Skills From the Previous Class?
Yes, you keep all the active and passive skills that you've learned from that class. However, certain skills and passives can only be used by certain classes. For instance, Behind Cover is a passive that is \<Knight-specific\>. This means you need be a knight class to have this passive active. Or take the active skill Hiding which is a \<Thief-specific\>. This means you have to be a thief class to use this skill. 

## What About Passives Like Passive HP Up (Fighter)? Do I Need To Be Fighter Class For This Passive?
No you don't need to be the specific class of passives that are in parantheses. Parantheses indicate origin of where the passive came from. Angled brackets indicate that is limited to specific classes. 

## Can I Class Change Back?
Your main character can freely change between classes that you have unlocked and activated in the Well of Mind. For summonable characters, you are going to either need the class change book corresponding to their original class or a special item called the class change request. Yes, you need to buy another class change book to change your class back and it's a different handbook. The class change request is given for free during class change events or purchased from certain limited packs from the jeweler.

## Why Am I Level 1? Does My Other Class Keep Their Levels?
Levels are independent to each class so you are going to have to relevel. 

## Why Are Some Characters Missing A Class Change?
Nameless units such as Human-pri can not class change. As of now newer released units don't come with their class change. Drecom will announce when their class change will come.

## When Should I Class Change?
For your main character, class change as soon as possible. The Wanderer Class doesn't get any new skills after level 20. For your other party members, it's up to personal preference. However, with new level caps coming, this means new potential skills so you might as well level the class to max before changing classes.

## Should I Stay As The Class That I Changed To Or Swap Back After Getting The Skills And Passives?
It depends. This is your personal preference for your playstyle. Keep in mind that classes scale differently on their base stats, have different resource pools, and having differing things they can equip.
