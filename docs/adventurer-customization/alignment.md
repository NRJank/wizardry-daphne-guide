# Alignment

All adventurers have an Alignment, including your own character.

There are three Alignments: 

 - Good
 - Neutral
 - Evil

This affects gameplay in several ways:

 - Eligibility for Formation Skills
   - For example, Rinne grants Surety to adjacent Evil allies.
 - Adventurers gain trust faster when their Alignment is closer to yours.

Adventurers other than yourself have fixed Alignment; there is no known way to change their alignment.

## Changing Your Alignment

Your character's alignment is initially defined by your answers to the [questions given at the start of the game](../abyss-guides/0-introduction/index.md#creating-your-character), but can change over the course of the game depending on your choices and actions.

Afterwards, there are two main ways to change alignment:

1. Action choices made towards enemies before combat.
2. Choices made during Story Progression.

Alignment operates on a numeric scale with the following pattern:

- Good: 18 and above
- Neutral: -17 to 17
- Evil: -18 and below

The following actions result in a shift of this scale.

### Towards Good

Acts of generosity will shift your alignment towards **Good**:

- When prompted before combat, select "Administer Healing Item" (+2 good)
- When prompted before combat, select "Ignore" (+1 good)

### Towards Evil

Dishonorable, selfish, or unethical acts will shift your alignment towards **Evil**:

- Sacrificing an adventurer in a certain request for unlocking the Ninja class (See Plot of the Sand Shadow).
- Stealing flowers from the little girl in a certain request. (See Memories of Charlotte)
- When prompted before combat, select "Ambush" (+2 evil)
- When prompted before combat, select "Attack" (+1 evil) 
- When prompted before combat, select "Plead" (+1 evil)
