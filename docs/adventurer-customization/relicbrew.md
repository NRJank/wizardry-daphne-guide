# Relicbrews

Upon completion of [Recovery of Belongings](../abyss-guides/2-port-town-grand-legion/requests.md#recovery-of-belongings) and subsequently [Recovery of Research Materials](../abyss-guides/2-port-town-grand-legion/requests.md#recovery-of-belongings), you unlock the ability to access Relicbrews at the Black Barrel Tavern.

## How to obtain

Relicbrews can be obtained by finding abyss relics off of red glowing monsters anywhere in the game. They spawn randomly and typically are specific to their enemy type. The quality and thus exp given by a relic is randomized as well. Each relic produces 1 drink, which can be consumed by up to 6 people at once.

## Effects

These are essentially permanent buffs that can be applied to all adventurers including the MC. They typically provide some sort of stat buff at the cost of some reduction in another stat. Effects can be leveled up by consuming the same type of brew again. Having a matching personality to the relicbrew will provide more bonus stats.

## Penalties

After drinking enough relicbrews, an adventurer and the MC can be affected by certain effects. This is indicated by the color of the swirl on the top left of the character portrait. By consuming brews of matching personality type, one can consume more beyond the limit before penalties begin showing.

It seems that an adventurer may safely drink up to 4 relicbrews before experiencing penalties, with a minimum of 2 relicbrew needing to match personality. A 5th relicbrew even if all matching alignment will raise an adventurer to stage 2 immediately. 

- Stage 0: Grey (Normal)
- Stage 1: White (Normal?)
- Stage 2: Purple (50 max fortitude, chance to be afflicted with confusion at start of every turn)
- Stage 3: Red (0 max fortitude, afflicted with confusion at start of every turn)

## Removal

These buffs can be removed through the surgery. On success, the adventurer will lose 1 max fortitude for 2 weeks. On failure, the adventurer will lose 5 max fortitude for 2 weeks. On great success, the adventurer does not lose any fortitude. It is recommended not to select emergency removal and only use special extraction. You can choose to use green gems, purple gems, or gold for removal, but it's generally recommended not to use any gems as of now.
