# Otherworld Adventurers

## Guide:
!!! note "There is no difficulty mode for this Event Dungeon. The mobs will scale automatically to your level."

There is only one ending for this event, and is relatively quick to complete (if you are strong). It takes a minimum of three cursed wheel resets to complete entirely however.

??? note "1st Run"
    1. Watch Cutscene in Event Tab.
    2. Head to Adventurer's Guild in the Royal Capital.
    3. Head to the event location, Sahuagin's Cave, via Edge of Town in the Royal Capital.
    4. Find 3 people on B1F to save. Move to the next floor.
    5. Find 2 people on B2F to save. They are dead already.
    6. Find an extra burned body on the way to the next floor. It's Iarumas.
    7. Go to the large, southern section of B3F, Fire Dragon will show up and start throwing fire everywhere (You may lag quite a bit at this part)
    8. Move to the non-red tiles on the minimap asap or get killed instantly (do this 3 times).
    9. Return to capital, watch cutscene, and then accept the Fire Dragon request at adventurer's guild, head to tavern to talk to Iarumas.
    10. Head back to dungeon B3F, try to fight the dragon again, but you are unable to (this part is important)
    11. Instead, now head to the sahuagin NPC on the minimap and kill them for a key.
    12. You can now open previously locked doors. Move ahead to the side of the Dragon.
    13. Have Iarumas distract the dragon and fight the dragon. However, it rages at the end and melts in the Magma.
    14. Turn in the request and get basically nothing. Rewind time with Cursed Wheel.

??? danger "Dragon Boss Fight Tips"
    - The boss fight scales with the MC's adventurer grade. At Steel Grade, the dragon has about 15k HP. On the other hand, Lead Grade is maybe around 5.5k HP. Bronze Grade is around 7.5k HP.
    - It's highly recommended for players Bronze Grade or lower to farm the Dragon Slayer weapon and upgrading it to +10 or so before attempting, as it's extremely strong for that level range.
    - The dragon is susceptible to Paralyze, not Stun. This is most likely to encourage people to use Iarumas's unique skill that paralyzes. Other sources are also more effective than usual but not guaranteed (Mimic Secretion, Thunder Strike, etc).
    - The dragon can be spellbound, but it does not stop its roar or breath. However, it will be more inclined to use basic attacks that can be exploited for openings.
    - Evasion helps mitigate a lot of physical moves the dragon does, but requires a large amount (possibly 200+ for Steel Grade).
    - Water elemental weapons and spells help deal more damage to the dragon. Water armor helps resist the fire breath.
    - Cortu can mitigate some damage from the breath and magic, as Iarumas suggests, but as the dragon can sometimes go twice in a turn with mixed damage, it may not be enough alone.
    - If your team has enough damage, consider using Knight's Defense to mitigate damage if your team's gear is not specced to deal with the dragon specifically
    - It's suggested to have two priests as the dragon can hit the entire team all at once, so having heals for both rows helps a lot.
    - You need a minimum of 43 ASPD to outspeed the dragon at Steel Grade.

??? note "2nd Run"
    1. Watch cutscene of Lulu looking for info. Select all the options.
    2. Use the key to go through door on b1f. You can now save all the people without them dying now.
    3. Find Berkanan at entrance to B3F, grab her body, and head down.
    4. Same Fire Dragon event again, just dodge the fire.
    5. Head back to town to resurrect Berkanan. She is quite tall.
    6. Head to adventurers guild, turn in quest, get dragon quest, head to tavern and talk to Berkana and Iarumas.
    7. Head to blacksmith, get request to pick up ore to make dragon slayer stuff.
    8. Head to the 3 locations on the map below to obtain the ores for the Dragon Slayer sword.
    9. Return to blacksmith to get sword, and then head back to the side tunnel to fight the dragon.
    10. Dragon is successfully killed this time, but Berkanan is burned to death again.
    11. Head back to town to turn in the request, and rewind time.

    3. Return to blacksmith for the sword and shield to give to Berkanan.
    4. Defeat the Dragon again and successfully kill without Berkanan dying.

## Farming The Event

There are three major ways to farm the event, each with their own pros and cons. Use your own judgement to determine which gives you the highest currency over time ratio.

* Map Reentry
    * Farming the event in this manner simply involves entering the map, moving to all the chests you see, then harkening out. This has the least amount of dialogue and loading screens but also the least amount of chests.
* Event Cursed Wheel
    * This has you using the event cursed wheel to reset the map. This resets both static chests on the first two floors as well as the stationary enemy encounters that have a high likelihood of dropping chests. This option has the most amount of dialogue and loading screens but also gives the highest number of chests.
* Main Cursed Wheel
    * This route involves you taking the cursed wheel back to either `The King's Rescue` or `Return to the Capital` and reentering the event dungeon. This is a bit of a middle ground between the above two options, as it respawns the static chests but not the stationary enemy encounters. It has fewer loading screens than the Event Cursed Wheel route, but more than the Map Reentry.
