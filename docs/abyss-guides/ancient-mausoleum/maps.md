# Ancient Mausoleum

#### ^^Summary^^

The Ancient Mausoleum is a source of guaranteed general/anonymous adventurers. You are guaranteed one bone for every adventurer in the Mausoleum. The general adventurer bones are separated by class, and anonymous adventurers and together in their own section. Each mausoleum map for the general adventurers is identical (the anonymous adventurer map is smaller) and you can only obtain one bone per visit. (Bones are located in a chest behind a door. Obtaining any one will lock all other doors.) It costs fortitude to enter the Ancient Mausoleum, as there are 3 tiles that drain the party's fortitude as you enter. You can only enter with 6 people, but you can keep entering even if your fortitude is 0.

Some battles in the Mausoleum are mandatory as the enemies block the way to the chests. However enemy spawn points do not change, so some can be waited for and avoided.  The Mausoleum becomes available after completing the Beginning Abyss for the first time.  While most enemies are the same encountered in the Beginning Abyss, they will be significantly harder and undead have an Insta-kill ability. Enemy level will also scale with you, making battles very challenging below level 30.  Necrocores can also be found right by the chest rooms. Avoiding those is advised.  

Enemies might drop a low to high grade chest. These can drop:

- Low Grade chests : Azureous Ore, Minor potions
- Medium Grade chests : Class Equipment Junk from what Class Mausoleum selected
- High Grade chests : Adventurer's bones 

Once more and more bones are found, the mausoleum will increasingly drop class specific junk. However, it's not recommended to farm the junk here. The number of bones found in each mausoleum area can be seen by tapping the (i) icon at the selection screen. The class and anonymous areas do not reset and once all bones are obtained, there is little reason to return to them.  

#### ^^Crucible Mausoleum^^

This part of the Mausoleum resets every 2 weeks and provides 5 random adventurer bones guaranteed. It's highly suggested to clear this out whenever you can. The map here is still the same as that of the general Ancient Mausoleum, though the scenery is slightly different.

??? note "Tips for Ancient Mausoleum"
    - It's recommended to bring undead-bane weapons. Evasion is also a very good stat to have to deal with dodging instant-kill skills.
    - Marein for priests can instantly kill most of the enemies (who also all try to stand in rows).
    - Any Insta-Kill Tolerance items, Malice Helm, Well of Mind Bonuses will help. Galina improves Instant-kill resistance for adjacent evil characters.
    - Beware of the Necrocore (Centaur) and the skeleton guards that might join him because they each have a skill that might Insta-Kill a party member.
    - It's recommended to run Ancient Mausoleum before you log off for a while, as you cannot go under 0 fortitude. So try to run as much as you can before you let fortitude recover.
