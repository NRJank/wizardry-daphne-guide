# Trust

A hidden stat called trust[^1] defines how much an adventurer trust you.

[^1]: Also commonly referred to as affinity.

## Increasing Trust

### Conversations

Conversations in tavern and during camping increase trust - if you choose
correct dialogue options. Strategy for farming conversations:

- Harken to B7F
- Open a treasure chest, but fail the trap disarming QTE on purpose
- Go camping at the fountain

Refer to [the chart](chart.md) for correct dialogue choices.

### Level Up

Grade/level up significantly increases trust. I have had multiple adventurers'
dialogues change from doing the Lv.30 -> Lv.40 bronze grade up. Unknown if
Lv.40 is required for max trust, but at least it makes it much easier.

### Should I be X aligned?

For establishing trust - no.

Matching alignment makes establishing trust much quicker, but it isn't too hard
with even opposite alignment. Most noticeable difference is how much longer it
takes for an opposite aligned adventurer to first initiate a conversation.

## Determining trust level

Determining current trust level is difficult and largely inexact science. Only
reliable ways are:

- Adventurer dialogue change
- Number of pages available in adventurer backstory (found in stats screen)
- White flaming heart symbol in stats screen, meaning maximum trust level

Having an adventurer initiate their first conversation also indicates a certain
level of trust. This can happen with matching aligned almost immediately, or
take a good while with opposite aligned.

## Can trust decrease?

Trust can decrease through various factors, though most being rather difficult to measure. This includes dying many many times repeatedly in battle, and triggering the Sinister Whispers trap found in Abyss 3 and onwards. It's very difficult however to lose trust faster than you can gain through normal gameplay. In addition, one can specifically lose large amounts of trust of Lanavaille by failing her personal request.

## Expensive Inn

Various theories exist about increasing trust, but they are difficult to test.
Most prevalent theory is using more expensive rooms at the Inn to increase
trust. No conclusive evidence exists of its efficacy, but based on testing and
player reports, using the expensive rooms seems like a waste of gold. It does
help keeping your adventurers clean though.

## Legendary Requests

The following conditions must be met to unlock an adventurer's legendary request:

- Trust Level 3
- At least 3 pages of unlocked life story

Note that the flaming heart is *NOT* required.
