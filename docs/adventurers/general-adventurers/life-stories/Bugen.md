Ina distant land far to the east dwell warriors who wield a weapon known as the katana. Those who do battle in service to their lord are called samurai...

The young Bugen heard such tales from a wayfaring dwarf and grew up aspiring to the way of life of those known as samurai.

A magnificent lord, and himself, a paragon of unwavering loyalty. Determined not to let it end as a mere dream, the grown Bugen became an adventurer and set his sights on the East.

The journey toward that dream was fraught with hardship. By sheer fate, he discovered a dojo founded by a samurai who was said to once have joined a party with dwarves as an adventurer, and it was there he gained a mentor in swordsmanship. Bugen endured the long and grueling days of training without a single word of complaint, and grew into a fully fledged swordsman.

However, mastering the sword was but a mere waystone upon the path to his true goal. Following the connections of those who had trained at the same dojo, Bugen traveled far and wide, lowering his gaze in respectful supplication until, at long last, he found a noble house willing to enlist dwarves as foot soldiers.

His life was one of poverty, and without taking on side work beyond the duties imposed by his superiors, he could scarcely make ends meet. Even owning a katana or proper armor proved beyond his means; each time he marched into battle, he was obliged to borrow a full set from his lord's house.

Nevertheless, Bugen continued his training in silence. On the battlefield, he was ever sent to the frontmost lines, pledging his loyalty to a lord glimpsed only from afar amid the chaos of battle.

Still, however one might risk their life, without a truly extraordinary feat, a lord would cast no eye upon a common soldier.

"It is my strength that is lacking. I must be of greater service."

In victory's wake, as common soldiers, denied sufficient spoils, turned to setting homes ablaze and plundering. Bugen turned his back on their savagery. Alone, he chastised his own inadequacy and returned to his arduous training.

Eventually, a great war unlike any before erupted. As ever, Bugen was sent to the vanguard, where he fought with fervent resolve. He came to the aid of his brethren, claimed many heads, and waded relentlessly through enemy forces.

Yet, however great his deeds, they were never given the same weight as those of a human samurai. The honors were stolen by the samurai generals, and as the tide of battle turned irrevocably toward defeat, Bugen was commanded to serve as rearguard.  It was tantamount to being told to die.

All that remained were peasant soldiers with no battle in their bones. Bugen saw to their escape, then stood alone upon the battlefield.

"I am a samurai. To die for my lord is the forge-fire of my heart."

Bugen stood firm before the advancing enemy host, katana held at the ready, and declared himself.

Then, before Bugen, the enemy's advance came to a halt. From among their ranks, a young warrior clad in resplendent armor strode forward and fixed his unwavering gaze upon Bugen, who stood alone to face him.
