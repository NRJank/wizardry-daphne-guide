Valdor is from the village of Eld in the northwesternregion of the continent. The village was located near a mine that produced valuable minerals and was home to around 100 dwarves.

Valdor's father worked as a blacksmith in the village. To a blacksmith, fire is crucial, as it determines the quality of a blade. Valdor's family also venerated fire as a deity, believing deeply, fearing and worshipping it. Having been brought up in such an environment, faith in this deity was quite heated.

One day, a skirmish broke out between two dukes who ruled lands near the village. Both duchies approached the dwarves with large orders for their high-quality weapons.

However, as the war dragged on, in an attempt to keep their enemies from obtaining the dwarves' fine weapons, the humans began sending soldiers to the village to capture and kill the blacksmiths.

The duchy's soldiers, with whom they would have close relations when things were quiet, drew their swords and threatened parents by holding their children hostage. Seeing such heinous acts, Valdor tried to appeal to morality, loudly proclaiming that "the gods see all."  

Even after being struck, Valdor stood his ground, and so the wrathful human drew his sword. Horrified by the impending danger to his family, Valdor's father ran between the soldier and his son. "I care not what happens to me. Just leave my son alone." he said, kneeling, as the soldier raised his sword high.  

Just then, the area was deluged with rain and lightning. A bolt struck the knight's brandished sword, and the man fell dead. The storm lasted for three days, flooding both army camps and drowning out their conflict. Valdor was convinced the gods had punished the arrogant humans.

The village of Eld sustained little damage from the storm. This miracle made Valdor think that, after all, the gods do indeed save those who have faith, and that he must spread faith to the world.  

But, Valdor could not just leave his family in their war-torn village. As he struggled with the pull of his faith and the bonds of his family, Valdor's father came to him.  

"You were the only one among us who stood up to preach our faith to the humans."  

His father told him that if Valdor felt he had to share his faith, then he should leave the village and spread it, and gave the hesitant Valdor a push.  

Later, after leaving the village of Eld, Valdor joined the Adventurer's Guild in a large town nearby. There he met all sorts of humans and walked the land preaching his faith.
