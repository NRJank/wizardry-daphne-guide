It was an ancient time, before it was even certain what name the continent even went by... There was another continent far away from there. 

A magical hole suddenly appeared in the continent, filled to the brim with monsters and treasure, as well as traps. There was an adventurer called **** who ventured into the dungeon. **** and his companions continued to take on the dungeon. Burned, decapitated, petrified, level-drained--he'd died many times. And each time he had returned from the underworld to challenge the dungeon once more. 

He had his own reason for being so obsessed with the dungeon. In the dungeon there exists a master of the dungeon. That master possessed an amulet which held limitless magical power. **** felt a powerful desire to kill the master of the dungeon and seize the amulet.

Just when was it that it happened? At the end of his adventure, **** came face to face with an old mage who was exuding a thick magical energy. This mage held an amulet that shone with pale white brilliance. **** understood instinctively. He needed to get his hands on it. It was why the man was still here. 

"****!!!" 

Someone was calling the man's name. In answer to that voice, he closed in on the old mage, his katana held tight. But **** lost his battle with the old mage. His consciousness once again fell into the darkness of death. 

How much time had passed since then? **** was resurrected at the temple and was returned to the world. However, he had lost his memories, perhaps because of how long it took for him to be resurrected.

What dimly remained in his heart was that he once had companions. That and a powerful desire to take the amulet. Apart from that, even his name is uncertain. However, having no name would be a hinderance later. **** then became Iarumas, although it is not clear whether he took the name himself or was given it by someone else.

He couldn't remember what happened to his companions after the fight with the old mage. But it is highly likely that they were now corpses, just like he was. Seeing the bodies of his companions and the amulet, Iarumas once again set out to explore the dungeon.

From his wanderings in search of corpses he was called Iarumas the corpse looter and shunned, but to Iarumas it was a trivial matter.

In the course of his exploration, the dungeon brought Iarumas new encounters.

Within the dungeon, one of the people Iarumas met was a slave girl kept by a group of rogue adventurers. Another was a boy thief, still an immature adventurer. Iarumas had no intention of taking them as companions. If they just came along, he wouldn't refuse them. And so, before he knew it, they had become his companions, and he had become completely acclimated to traveling with them.

One day, while exploring, the dungeon floor opened under the feet of the girl traveling with him, swallowing her up. A chute.

Strange. It wasn't the first time the girl, who had been jumping, running around, and swinging her sword the entire time, had stepped on that spot of floor. If the chute was triggered by weight, it would have gone off at the first step. So why did it open now? Was it targeting her? If so, that meant... Someone's controlling the dungeon? It could only be the master of the dungeon. Without hesitation, Iarumas jumped down the chute.

At the bottom of the pit, Iarumas and the girl came up against a robed man. In the man's hand was an amulet.

The way Iarumas formed signs with his left hand made it look like he had done it many times before. And then he began chanting the true words of the spell.

Taila tazanme woarif lyeta!!! (O swift wind, be unleashed together with the light.)

TILTOWAIT.

Iarumas had defeated the robed man and obtained the amulet. But the tiny shard was nothing compared to the object in Iarumas's memories. This was only a shard of the amulet. A fragment, one of hundreds. Even so...getting a fragment of the amulet was like a badge of honor for any adventurer.

It wasn't as though anything dramatically changed after that. With one sole exception: these three were now exploring the dungeon together. Iarumas came to feel that it was not that unpleasant. And so today, too, they make their way to the dungeon.
