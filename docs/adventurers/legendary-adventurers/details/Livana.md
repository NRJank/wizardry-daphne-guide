## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Oh Livana, we had high hopes for you. As a big fan of 2h weapons in general, I've been exited about the idea of a 2h-focused Fighter since the game came out, and...this one is not what I had in mind at all.

    First, as a passive, `The One Who Enforces` is somewhat decent. Surety and Accuracy are two solid stats to increase for 2h axe usage, and the increase itself is a flat +7 of each. This is roughly equivalent to the gains of a Discipline 2 featured stat, being somewhat higher than Discipline 2 but not quite to the same value of Discipline 3.

    And while I'm mentioning Discipline, `Bloodline of the Mirror-Mere` is not that great. Accuracy is fine, but Magic Defense is lackluster, and neither are really worth focusing on. Discipline her if you want, but just remember that the gain per duplicate value is low.

    Her `Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon` is an interesting skill. I'm not a huge fan of active skills as the signature skill on a damage-dealing adventurer in general since we never know what future skill could come along to render a signature skill largely irrelevant (I'm looking at you, Gerard), but I'm not quite as bothered by it in this case. This is mainly because her signature skill isn't going to be your main focus for dealing damage - instead, it'll be a situational utility attack. Being a moderate attack, the damage should be comparable to Gerulf's Eruption Strike and Gerard's Thunderstrike. As a water attack, it will also deal type-effective damage on par with Gerulf and stronger than Gerard due to Livana herself also being a water type. Just remember to inherit in Adam if you plan to use her to fight earth type enemies. In addition to ignoring range, this skill can apply Spell-Binding and is our first debuff focused on reducing an enemy's Magic Power.
    
    `Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon` will ultimately allow you to treat her 2h axe (or whatever weapon, but if you're running her, you should be using a 2h axe) as a Bow and hit at any range. There is one big limitation with this skill, though - it is a forced single hit attack, which means if you're using her with a dagger or sword and a shield, she will still only deal one attack with it. That's pretty much a non-issue if you're using a 2h axe, but it's something to keep in mind, particularly if you want to inherit this skill to someone else. Unfortunately, this skill also does not seem to gain the damage increase that `Way of the Warrior` provides, likely due to it not being considered dealing close-range damage.

    One potential use case of inheriting `Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon` to a non-Livana adventurer would be to give it to a back-row adventurer (such as a mage, priest, knight, or thief) using the Staff of Weakness. Since this is a skill and not a spell, it would allow the adventurer to apply the Staff of Weakness debuff from the back row without an accuracy loss. Likely not the best action for a turn in most cases, but could occasionally be useful.

    Looking at Livana holistically, she's in an interesting spot. Her closest comparisons are going to be Abenius and Gerard, with the former being largely a bit better for current content and the latter being a bit weaker in all content in my opinion. She has a specific use case of being able to deal solid ranged damage as a Fighter without needing to swap weapons to a Bow, which I like, and she provides some interesting utility in the anti-spellcaster department. In current content, the only situation where her niche would really provide a lot of value is against the Gatekeeper, during a phase of the fight where you don't necessarily need to rush with your damage dealing. She can help you kill the weak point a bit faster, particularly if you're not running multiple TZALIK casters, but in no way is that actually required. That being said, given that after Abenius got released, we saw a massive increase in the number of Magical Beasts we fought, it wouldn't surprise me if upcoming content included more dangerous long-range spellcasters that put most heavy Fighter parties at a disadvantage. That future unknown alone could be worth pulling for her to have just in case.

    She is in no way a must-pull and for many people, she is an easy skip in order to save for our first Samurai in the near future. If you do pull, I would try not to pull more than 1-2 copies unless you really like her design.

    Full Disclosure: This unit’s release prompted me to begin articulating my thoughts on how Drecom designs units with these reviews. Previously, Livana was aggressively mid. Now that 2-handed weapons got buffed with basically double damage and increased blessing values are on the way, this one needs to be re-evaluated.

    Problem 1: An awful discipline focus. Accuracy and Mag Def…not Attack or Surety, even Action Speed would have been fine. Something unusual, like Luck, could have been strong to pair with Follow-up Attack. Mag Def on a premium unit…What a joke!

    Problem 2: That active skill, Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon. Fighters want to use Full Power Strike when sustained damage is needed and Heavy Attack 3 when they need damage quickly. With all the data the devs have showing that skills like Thunder/Eruption Strike aren’t used by players, why did they create a skill in the same vein but blue? Post-2-hand weapon buff, this skill is outrageous. It seems that the soft cap for this skill is incredibly high or nonexistent. Even when inherited, Mages/Priests with 2-hand staves can get relatively high damage from just lvl 1 of this skill (and surety). It does have some utility with ignoring the distance penalty, and the Magic Power debuff seems consistent even when inherited, but that part is less useful as there are few enemies you’d really want that for. 

    Problem 3: That Passive skill. +7 Accuracy and Surety when using a 2-handed axe is a joke. How did they release something like this when they already got it right with Iarumas’s & Berkanan’s version of this? Their passives give them a boost to more than 2 stats at a potency comparable to decent blessings as if it were a shield or 2nd accessory and isn’t limited to 1 weapon type. 

    I anticipate this banner will be one of the worst-performing banners yet for Drecom. This is unadulterated “Mid”; general adventurers like Elise and Benjamin are better than this. I have no idea what the devs were thinking when they came up with this; I guess they weren’t. My best guess is that they are thinking ahead to what the legendary pool will look like when previous legends get mass demoted to the base pool and felt the need to dilute it with a new stinker. My bad; she’s got a job now: Big Damage for 9sp.(need to use a 2-hand weapon)

## Adventurer Pull Plans

??? note "TheAxolotl's Pull Plan"
    Her kit is just interesting enough to me that I might pull a bit in anticipation of having to worry about long range damage in the future. If I snag a copy with the free bones, I'll likely pull another for the OCD Discipline. If I don't, I'll wait and decide for sure later.

??? note "Lynd's Pull Plan"
    I wasn't totally convinced to pull but I showed my friend her art and he responded with "Step on me, dommy mommy." So I pulled out of respect for his lack of shame until I got a copy.
    
## Duplicate Usage

* Inherit on her own skill will increase the efficacy of `Moonlit Pool of the White Daemon`
* Discipline is nothing stellar, but will boost some of her stats a bit
* Inheriting to the MC or another favorite damage dealer is an option, but I'd personally avoid that due to the damage loss, forced single it, and lower chance of applying the bind or debuff
