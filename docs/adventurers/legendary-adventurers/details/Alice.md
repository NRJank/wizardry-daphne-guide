## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"
    
    Alice is a fantastic unit to pull, and will likely be a staple in most folks' parties for a long while. Not only is she our first Legendary priest, but both of her skills are fantastic. Increasing her buff/debuff turn count by 1 means she gets an extra turn to heal, deal damage, or apply another buff/debuff before needing to reapply the initial. Furthermore, her damage increase to a row can apply to many af our strongest damage dealers.

    Changing her class to Mage will give her a wider selection of spells, as well, making her a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.

    To make things even better, many other characters will benefit from Alice duplicates. Inheriting her skill on your other favorite buffers/debuffers will allow them to each provide an extra turn for their buffs/debuffs!

    The turn duration increase from her Blessing of Agora skill adds one to the counter at rank three (on Alice, rank 5 on non-Alice), so it's possible to get at least a 5-turn duration on buffs and debuffs, which adds to the strength increasing her skill through inheritence.

    If you pull Alice, she will be a fantastic addition to your team!

??? info "Frobro's Analysis"

    Simple but effective. It didn’t take much to be the best in slot at what she does. Optimized stat line from Water/Elf/Female and has the ideal double caster class set. The best buffer/debuffer in the game; being able to reach a turn cap that other characters cannot. A rock-solid unit when used and desirable inherit when not. 

    A passive 10% damage increase with an easily met condition for the whole row. Has access to an, as of now unreleased spell with her Secrets of Labadios just ‘cuz. An alright discipline focus with Divine Power and Magic Def; not good, not bad. The MP gains from leveling up Blessing of Agora feels like she has 3rd discipline anyway.

    You can change her into a mage (after learning all priest spells first) and sacrifice some HP/armor and gain some MP and the entire suite of mage spells, with practically no loss of healing potency.

    There isn’t much to say; this chick excels in the roles that units like her were designed to play and has some staying power with her inherit should the game ever shift to being more buff/debuff-centric.

??? info "Shiro's Analysis"

    Starting with her inheritance we have access to basically “cheat” and arguably best inheritance in the game. Having bonus one or two turn duration on any character or even up to four Alice is absurdly game changing for any buff/debuff rotation allowing things like lasting warrior battlecry enough for two FPS rotations. It’s even more impactful on priests and mages, giving them bonus free turns for any sort of healing, more consistent rotations, usage of items or additional damage. Some people seriously downplay how strong is passive that basically breaks one of game rules. Great to have lvl 1 on everyone and maxed out on Alice. You’ll be playing two different games depending if you have it or not.

    Moving to her passive. It’s lane DMG buff which is nice but I’m personally not really impressed by those whenever it’s Alice or Lana. It’s nice to min max damage and it might help but the impact isn’t that strong unless you stack multiple of them (like Milana or Madam on top of it) so in the end it’s still a solid option especially if you run Alice as mage.

    Moving to her discipline while it’s somewhat nice to have I wouldn’t even consider investing in it especially when her inheritance is so powerful. Might be a different case if we get her alternative style in future but I can’t imagine what kind of disc it would need to have to even compete with another option to use her additional copies. 

    Her class change is mage. Which is absolutely the best option available with access to more MP based spells, offensive abilities or debuffs. Especially impactful on Alice with access up to four bonus turns on everything she cast. On top of that she has the perfect setup to be a mage leaving poor Adam behind and being able to compete with Sheli having edge over the supportive part while falling in pure damage to her. 

    To sum it up Alice is an absurdly strong option for both priest and mage. And honestly? Our arguably best caster that is sometimes downplayed. She’s not only breaking game rules making some short duration buffs really strong but she’s also a great magic damage dealer thanks to being female-water-elf mage. While this game doesn’t have any “must have” characters Alice will definitely make your game way easier when you’ll invest into her. As for now we don’t have any better supportive option so go ahead and worship Agora and enjoy the easier mode of the game with the strongest caster next to Sheli.

## Duplicate Usage

* Inherit her skill on other buffers/debuffers you use. This is a great inherit for almost any adventurer, and extends the duration of most time-based abilities including Warrior's Battle Cry, Mental Unity, and even the Knight's three Cover skills.
* If you plan to use Alice, increasing her Discipline will increase her damage and healing.
* Save for future use.
